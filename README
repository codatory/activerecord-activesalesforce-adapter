== Welcome to Active Salesforce

ActiveSalesforce is an extension to the Rails Framework that allows for the dynamic creation and management of ActiveRecord objects through the use of Salesforce meta-data and uses a Salesforce.com organization as the backing store.

== Getting started

1. gem install silent-e-activerecord-activesalesforce-adapter

2. If you have not already done so generate your initial rails app:

    rails myappname

3. Edit config/environment.rb and add a config.gem requirement:

    Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
      ...
      config.gem "silent-e-activerecord-activesalesforce-adapter", :lib => 'activerecord-activesalesforce-adapter'
      ...
    end

4. Edit database.yml

    development:
      adapter: activesalesforce
      username: <salesforce user name goes here>
      password: <salesforce password goes here>

    NOTE: "url" is an optional parameter.  If you want to access your Salesforce Sandbox account add the following line.
    
      url: https://test.salesforce.com

5. Create your salesforce models using a Salesforce::<ModelName> namespace.

    script/generate model Salesforce::Contact

6. Run a quick test to make sure things are working

    > script/console
    Loading development environment (Rails 2.3.9)
    
    >> Salesforce::Contact.first
    => <Salesforce::Contact id: "003T000000GqvJsIAJ", ... >

7. Proceed using standard Rails development techniques!

== Advanced Features

1. Session ID based Authentication: Add the following to /app/controllers/application.rb to enable SID auth for all controllers

   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
     before_filter ActiveSalesforce::SessionIDAuthenticationFilter
   end

2. Boxcar'ing of updates, inserts, and deletes. Use <YourModel>.transaction() to demark boxcar boundaries.

== Description of contents

lib
 Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't
 belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.

script
 Helper scripts for automation and generation.

test
 Unit and functional tests along with fixtures.

== Note about my (silent-e) fork

I created this fork to fix a problem I was having with SELECT statements.  Salesforce enforces single-quote escaping in strings with a backspace in WHERE condition expressions.  However, in INSERT and UPDATE statements the VALUES are escaped with two consecutive single-quotes.  See the table below for a visual explanation of my clumsy text one.  :)

This fork specifically tweaks SELECT WHERE conditions and is based on blaines work on bringing ASF up to speed with Rails 3.  I will attempt to keep it in step with blaines work until we can get a consensus and possibly get a official update to the canonical ASF gem.

| Query Type                  | Escape sequence required                            |
| WHERE (conditionExpression) | ... WHERE (Name = 'Let\'s do the Time Warp again!') |
| INSERT/UPDATE               | ... VALUES ('Let''s do the Time Warp again!')       |
