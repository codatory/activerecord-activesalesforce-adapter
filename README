== Welcome to Active Salesforce

ActiveSalesforce is an extension to the Rails Framework that allows for the dynamic creation and management of ActiveRecord objects through the use of Salesforce meta-data and uses a Salesforce.com organization as the backing store.

== Getting started

1. gem install johnreilly-activerecord-activesalesforce-adapter --source http://gems.github.com

2. If you have not already done so generate your initial rails app:

    rails myappname

3. Edit config/environment.rb and add a config.gem requirement:

    Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
      ...
      config.gem "johnreilly-activerecord-activesalesforce-adapter", :source => 'http://gems.github.com', :lib => 'activerecord-activesalesforce-adapter'
      ...
    end

4. Edit database.yml

    development:
      adapter: activesalesforce
      url: https://www.salesforce.com
      username: <salesforce user name goes here>
      password: <salesforce password goes here>

    NOTE: If you want to access your Salesforce Sandbox account use https://test.salesforce.com as your url instead.

5. Create your salesforce models using a Salesforce::<ModelName> namespace.

    script/generate model Salesforce::Contact

6. Run a quick test to make sure things are working

    > script/console
    Loading development environment (Rails 2.3.3)
    
    >> Salesforce::Contact.first
    => <Salesforce::Contact id: "003T000000GqvJsIAJ", ... >

7. Proceed using standard Rails development techniques!

== Advanced Features

1. Session ID based Authentication: Add the following to /app/controllers/application.rb to enable SID auth for all controllers

   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
     before_filter ActiveSalesforce::SessionIDAuthenticationFilter
   end

2. Boxcar'ing of updates, inserts, and deletes. Use <YourModel>.transaction() to demark boxcar boundaries.
